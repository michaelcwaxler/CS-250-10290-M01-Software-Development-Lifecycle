How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The knowledge required to incorporate the user's demands into a program is obtained by listening to what they have to say, identifying their needs, and converting those needs into requirements. The user's needs are converted into requirements and acceptance criteria during the user story creation process. By the time the user story is finished, these two factors help to guarantee that the user's demands will be satisfied and that they will be pleased with the final product.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development by examining the request, identifying needs and requirements, and determining where to begin and what is required to make the program function. I intend to use a lot of the Scrum event procedures in my upcoming development projects. One way to make a project easier to manage would be to employ user stories and create a backlog of tasks to do. It would be simpler to stay on top of tasks if you combined that with a Kanban board.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

In software development, being a good team player means a number of things. Arrive on time for meetings, participate and speak up, and express your thoughts and provide feedback to others. Additionally, be receptive to feedback. Update the sprint board with the current state of your projects. If you don't have anything left to do, pick up the next story. Conduct code reviews and, when necessary, provide insightful feedback.
